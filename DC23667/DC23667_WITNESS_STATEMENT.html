<div class="para"><span class="n">1.</span><span class="t">
  I am the Claimant in these proceedings. I am a former student of the Defendant,
  The University of Law Limited. I was enrolled on the LLB (Bachelor of Laws) programme
  at the London Bloomsbury Campus. My student number is associated with the email address
  ben.mak71@law.ac.uk.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">2.</span><span class="t">
  This statement is made in support of my challenge to the decision to exclude me from
  the University of Law, communicated by letter dated 13 May 2024 and authored by Rachel Edge,
  Secretary of the Stage 3 Support to Study Panel.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">3.</span><span class="t">
  The evidence relied upon in this statement is drawn entirely from the Defendant's own records:
  an export of my institutional inbox comprising 1,837 pages (referred to herein as 'DC23667')
  and my sent-items engagement record comprising 214 pages (referred to herein as 'the Engagement PDF').
  Highlighted screenshots of the relevant pages are available at the URLs set out in Schedule 2
  of this statement.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">4.</span><span class="t">
  I have had the opportunity to review the letter of 13 May 2024 and the supporting documentation.
  I contend that the exclusion decision was reached in breach of procedural fairness, in breach of
  the institution's duty of care, and in breach of the Equality Act 2010.
</span></div>

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<div class="part-hdr">Part II — Background</div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">5.</span><span class="t">
  I enrolled at the University of Law on or about September 2022. I hold a diagnosis of autism
  spectrum condition, which was disclosed to the Defendant prior to and during my studies.
  A University Learning and Inclusion Plan (ULIP) was put in place to provide for adjustments
  in accordance with the Equality Act 2010, section 20.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">6.</span><span class="t">
  During the academic year 2023–2024, I experienced significant personal difficulties including
  housing repossession, financial hardship, and a mental health crisis. These difficulties were
  disclosed to the Defendant through multiple channels, as set out in Part III below.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">7.</span><span class="t">
  On 15 February 2024, Debbie Shortland, the Designated Safeguarding Lead at the University of Law,
  sent an email to statutory health and safeguarding services in Westminster. The email stated in
  material part: <em>"he has suicidal thoughts… Ben stated that if this meeting was not held… he would
  end his life. We have made referrals today to statutory health and safeguarding services in
  Westminster."</em> This email is at DC23667 page 540. I refer to the highlighted screenshot at
  Exhibit BM7.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">8.</span><span class="t">
  On the same day, 15 February 2024, I sent an email to mentalhealthservice@law.ac.uk and
  Debbie.Shortland@law.ac.uk with the subject line <em>"Not one call or check in followg
  Repossesion."</em> This email is at Engagement PDF page 25. I refer to the highlighted screenshot
  at Exhibit BM8.
</span></div>

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<div class="part-hdr">Part III — The Claim of Non-Engagement</div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">9.</span><span class="t">
  The letter of 13 May 2024 states: <em>"You did not engage with the course."</em> This claim is
  made without citation of any specific evidence. I set out below the evidence which demonstrates
  that this assertion is false.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">10.</span><span class="t">
  My email address, ben.mak71@law.ac.uk, appears on 855 pages of the DC23667 inbox export. The
  Engagement PDF records 93 emails SENT by me during the relevant period. I contacted 81 unique
  email addresses, of which 25 or more were @law.ac.uk addresses. I refer to the highlighted
  screenshot at Exhibit BM1.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">11.</span><span class="t">
  I engaged with my academic coach, Chris Hooley, throughout the period. Hooley appears on 23
  pages of DC23667. I received 20 emails from him. Course materials — including worksheet slides,
  mock assessment materials, and revision tips — were delivered to me via email throughout the year.
  I refer to the highlighted screenshots at Exhibits BM3 and BM4.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">12.</span><span class="t">
  The letter states: <em>"You did not liaise with your PSL Salome Verrell and the Student Journey
  Advice team."</em> Salome Verrell appears on 13 pages of DC23667. Seven emails were received from
  Salome; six were sent to Salome. On 26 April 2024 — 17 days before the exclusion decision — Salome
  sent the Revision Hotline Schedule directly to me. I refer to the highlighted screenshot at
  Exhibit BM2.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">13.</span><span class="t">
  On 2 November 2023, Salome replied to me in correspondence captioned <em>"RE: Hey"</em>
  (Engagement PDF page 139). On 7 December 2023, Debbie Shortland CC'd Salome on correspondence
  captioned <em>"meet Ben for course support"</em> (Engagement PDF page 121). The communication
  channel between myself and my PSL was open and active.
</span></div>

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<div class="part-hdr">Part IV — The Claim of No Progression</div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">14.</span><span class="t">
  The letter states: <em>"There has been no progression since the first Support to Study meeting.
  You did not address any of the actions in the Action Plan."</em> I address each Action Plan item
  in turn.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">15.</span><span class="t">
  Action Plan item 3 required me to review my ULIP with a DIS advisor. On or after 1 February 2024,
  Angele Venchard of the Disability and Inclusion Service emailed me stating: <em>"As promised by
  the DIS Manager, Brian, we are happy to help going forward"</em> and offered a ULIP review and
  appointment booking. This offer was initiated by the institution. DC23667 page 640. I refer to the
  highlighted screenshot at Exhibit BM5.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">16.</span><span class="t">
  No documented follow-up was made by the institution when the appointment was not booked. I contacted
  the Disability Support Service on five separate occasions. Engagement PDF page 188 records my email
  to disabilitysupportservice@law.ac.uk regarding a DSA application.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">17.</span><span class="t">
  The letter's assertion of <em>"no progression"</em> is measured solely against on-campus
  attendance. During the same period, I was engaged with: Debbie Shortland (Designated Safeguarding
  Lead), who made referrals to Westminster statutory services on 15 February 2024; Richard Jones at
  Shelter (10 pages of correspondence regarding housing support); Stonewall Housing; and Survivors UK.
  Welfare, legal, and housing progression — all directly affecting my ability to engage with my course
  — were not considered by the Panel.

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<div class="part-hdr">Part V — Procedural Failures</div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">18.</span><span class="t">
  <strong>The Appeal Email.</strong> On 12 March 2024 at 16:09:06, an appeal email was sent from
  authority@legaldueprocess.com to Jane Chappell, Salome Verrell, Megan Liskevich, Brian Lutchmiah,
  and Sandie Gaines. I was CC'd at ben.mak71@law.ac.uk. The email carried an attachment:
  Uni of law appeal 2024.pdf (5MB). This email is at DC23667 page 388. I refer to the highlighted
  screenshot at Exhibit BM6.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">19.</span><span class="t">
  The letter of 13 May 2024 states that this email <em>"was delivered into the junk boxes of the
  respective colleagues."</em> This email appears in the DC23667 inbox export — the very archive
  from which the Defendant compiled its case against me. It was CC'd to my own institutional address.
  It was received. It was stored. DC23667 page 526 records that the institution was aware of quarantine
  issues on its Exchange system. I refer to the highlighted screenshot at Exhibit BM9.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">20.</span><span class="t">
  The email in question is a three-page formal submission citing Equality Act 2010 sections 20(3)
  and 20(4); twelve or more specific University of Law policy page references; formal questions
  requiring answers; and specific procedural objections to the Stage 2 process. It raises safeguarding
  as an extenuating circumstance. The Panel's reasoning for dismissing it is not recorded. It existed
  for 62 days before the exclusion decision was made.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">21.</span><span class="t">
  <strong>The Stage 2 Review Meeting.</strong> The Stage 2 meeting was held on 7 March 2024. I was
  not in attendance. I contend that no 15-minute meeting reminder was sent, contrary to the institution's
  standard practice. I was at my computer at the time the meeting was scheduled. The meeting was held
  20 days after the suicidal disclosure documented at paragraph 7 above. No welfare check was conducted
  before the meeting proceeded and a decision was made about my future in my absence.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">22.</span><span class="t">
  <strong>The Stage 3 Notification.</strong> The Stage 3 Notification was issued by Sandie Gaines on
  18 March 2024 — six calendar days after the appeal email was sent. The Stage 3 Notification makes no
  reference to the appeal having been received or considered. Whether the appeal was in junk or not, six
  days is insufficient time to discover, retrieve, read, and consider a three-page Equality Act submission
  before escalating the process.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">23.</span><span class="t">
  <strong>The 26-Day Silence.</strong> The Stage 3 meeting was held on 17 April 2024. The exclusion letter
  was dated 13 May 2024. Between those dates: twenty-six days of silence. No communication. No interim
  letter. No acknowledgement that a decision was pending. No welfare check. On 10 May 2024, the institution
  sent me a module evaluation reminder. On 13 May 2024, it sent the exclusion letter.
</span></div>

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<div class="part-hdr">Part VI — Safeguarding</div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">24.</span><span class="t">
  The disclosure of suicidal ideation on 15 February 2024 was made formally, in writing, by the
  Designated Safeguarding Lead, with referrals to statutory services. This disclosure does not appear
  in any subsequent academic decision documentation. It does not feature in the Stage 2 meeting of
  7 March 2024. It does not feature in the Stage 3 letter of 13 May 2024. It was compartmentalised
  away from the process that ended my education. I refer to the highlighted screenshot at Exhibit BM7.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">25.</span><span class="t">
  Megan Liskevich, Mental Health Advisor, sat on the Stage 2 panel. The suicidal disclosure was 20 days
  old. She did not raise it. She did not request a welfare check. She did not pause the proceedings.
  This is the person whose role is specifically to assess mental health risk.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">26.</span><span class="t">
  I contend that safeguarding and academic progression cannot lawfully be treated as separate systems.
  A suicidal disclosure documented by the Designated Safeguarding Lead must inform any subsequent
  academic decision about that student. This is not optional. It is a baseline duty of care.

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<div class="part-hdr">Part VII — Conflicts of Interest</div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">27.</span><span class="t">
  <strong>Brian Lutchmiah — Conflict of Interest.</strong> Brian Lutchmiah is the DIS Manager. On or
  after 1 February 2024, he promised ULIP support, which was actioned by Angele Venchard (DC23667 page
  640). Brian Lutchmiah subsequently sat, without recusal, on the Stage 2 panel. The Stage 3 letter
  states that Action Plan item 3 — which was the ULIP review promised by Lutchmiah — was not completed.
  He judged whether his own promise was kept. He did not recuse himself. He did not flag the conflict.
  I refer to the highlighted screenshot at Exhibit BM5.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">28.</span><span class="t">
  <strong>Salome Verrell — Prior Knowledge.</strong> Salome Verrell was CC'd on three support and
  safeguarding-related emails in November and December 2023 (Engagement PDF pages 121, 126, 127). She
  was aware of my autism diagnosis, my financial situation, and my need for course support. She sat on
  the Stage 2 panel. She sent me a group email on 26 April 2024 — 17 days before my exclusion. The claim
  that I <em>"did not liaise with my PSL"</em> is directly contradicted by her own correspondence record.

<div class="para"><span class="n">29.</span><span class="t">
  On 10 May 2024, Teaching Quality Evaluation sent me a reminder to submit feedback on my modules:
  Law of Organisations, Administrative Law &amp; Human Rights, Practice, and Tort Law. The institution
  was asking for my course feedback. Three days before ending my course. DC23667 page 95. I refer to
  the highlighted screenshot at Exhibit BM10.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">30.</span><span class="t">
  On 13 May 2024 at 15:04, Pro Bono (London) emailed me advertising summer term pro bono opportunities.
  On the same day, Rachel Edge sent the exclusion letter. The exclusion was not communicated across the
  institution before it was enacted. I refer to the highlighted screenshot at Exhibit BM11.
</span></div>

<div class="para"><span class="n">31.</span><span class="t">
  The institution's own Exchange system — ulaw365.onmicrosoft.com — was generating documented
  Undeliverable bounces in January and February 2024. A quarantine filter was known to be misfiring on
  SharePoint links. The appeal email arrived in March on this same system. The <em>"junk"</em> defence
  is an infrastructure failure owned by the institution. I refer to the highlighted screenshot at
  Exhibit BM12.
