  <b>Preamble.</b> This determination identifies seven previously unacknowledged evidentiary threads
  within the email record. Each thread is a discrete chain of causation linking a specific individual
  to a specific failure. The threads do not stand alone — they converge. Taken individually, each is
  serious. Taken together, they constitute a pattern that is not consistent with oversight.
  It is consistent with a decision that was reached before the process began.

    <p>Salome was CC'd on three support and safeguarding-adjacent emails between November and December 2023.
    She was aware of the student's autism diagnosis, his financial situation, and his need for course support.
    She sat on the Stage 2 panel three months later. The claim that Ben <em>"did not liaise with his PSL"</em>
    was made by a PSL who had been formally informed of his circumstances, who had informal contact with him
    (<em>RE: Hey</em>, 2 Nov 2023), and who sent him a group email 17 days before his exclusion. The claim is
    not a finding — it is a contradiction of her own inbox.</p>

    <p>The exclusion was not coordinated across the institution. The marketing and academic quality teams
    were still actively treating Ben as a current student on the day — and three days before — his exclusion.
    This means either: (a) the decision was made quietly and not communicated internally before acting, or
    (b) the decision was made so hastily that standard administrative processes were not paused. Either way,
    the exclusion did not go through a process that informed the whole institution. It went through a process
    that informed only the Panel.</p>

    <p>The "junk box" defence is attributed to the student as if it were his failure. It was not.
    The institution's own Exchange system — ulaw365.onmicrosoft.com — was generating Undeliverable bounces
    in January and February 2024. A quarantine filter was actively misfiring on SharePoint links in February.
    The appeal email arrived in March on this same system. The probability that six separate inboxes
    simultaneously filtered one email to junk — on a system already known to be misfiring — is not a
    student failure. It is an infrastructure failure. The institution owns the infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Twenty-six days of silence after a meeting where a student's education was ended. No communication.
    No support referral. No safeguarding check — despite the suicidal disclosure being 57 days old at that
    point. The encrypted letter format suggests awareness that the content would be distressing. That awareness
    did not extend to proactive support before delivery.</p>

    <p>They sat with the decision for 26 days. They told no one. They did not check on him. They asked him
    to review his course on the 10th. They ended it on the 13th. The silence was not administrative delay.
    It was deliberate distance.</p>

<!-- FINAL DETERMINATION -->
<div class="final">
  <h2>Final Determination</h2>

  <div class="finding">
    <div class="f-num">Finding 1 — Conflict of Interest (Brian Lutchmiah)</div>
    <p>Brian Lutchmiah, as DIS Manager, initiated the ULIP support offer through Angele Venchard on or after
    1 February 2024. He subsequently sat, without recusal, on the Stage 2 panel that declared the student had
    failed to act on that exact item. This constitutes a direct conflict of interest in the decision-making process.
    <b>The finding on Action Plan item 3 is tainted.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="finding">
    <div class="f-num">Finding 2 — Prior Knowledge (Salome Verrell)</div>
    <p>Salome Verrell was CC'd on three support and safeguarding-related emails in November and December 2023.
    She had informal contact with the student. She sent him a group email on 26 April 2024. The claim that the
    student <em>"did not liaise with his PSL"</em> is directly contradicted by her own correspondence record.
    <b>The liaison claim is unsustainable.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="finding">
    <div class="f-num">Finding 3 — Duty of Care Breach (Megan Liskevich)</div>
    <p>The Mental Health Advisor sat on a panel 20 days after a suicidal disclosure by the same student had been
    formally documented by the institution's Designated Safeguarding Lead. She did not raise the disclosure.
    She did not request a welfare check. She did not pause the proceedings.
    <b>This is a failure of the specific duty held by her role.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="finding">
    <div class="f-num">Finding 4 — Institutional Incoherence (Same-Day Paradox)</div>
    <p>The institution requested the student's course feedback on 10 May 2024 and marketed summer opportunities
    to him on 13 May 2024 — the same day his exclusion letter was issued. The exclusion was not communicated
    across the institution before it was enacted. <b>The process was not coordinated. It was localised to the Panel.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="finding">
    <div class="f-num">Finding 5 — Infrastructure Failure Misattributed (Email System)</div>
    <p>The institution's Exchange system (ulaw365.onmicrosoft.com) generated documented Undeliverable bounces
    in January and February 2024. A quarantine filter was known to be misfiring on SharePoint links. The appeal
    email, sent to six recipients on this system, was attributed to the student as a failure to engage.
    The email exists in the institution's own archive.
    <b>The "junk" defence is an infrastructure failure owned by the institution, not the student.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="finding">
    <div class="f-num">Finding 6 — Audi Altera Partem (The Appeal Was Not Heard)</div>
    <p>A formal appeal citing Equality Act s.20(3) and s.20(4), twelve specific policy page references, and
    direct questions requiring answers was sent to every member of the decision-making panel and the Dean.
    It existed for 62 days before the exclusion decision. It was dismissed as containing
    <em>"no relevant information"</em> without recorded reasoning. The questions it posed received no documented
    response. <b>The right to be heard was not exercised. It was extinguished.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="finding">
    <div class="f-num">Finding 7 — Safeguarding Compartmentalisation</div>
    <p>A suicidal disclosure was made on 15 February 2024 by the Designated Safeguarding Lead — formally, in
    writing, with referrals to statutory services. This disclosure did not appear in any subsequent academic
    decision documentation. It did not feature in the Stage 2 meeting. It did not feature in the Stage 3
    letter. It was compartmentalised away from the process that ended the student's education.
    <b>Safeguarding and academic progression were treated as separate systems. They are not.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="closing">
    <p>Seven threads. Seven individuals or systems, each failing at a specific, identifiable point.
    None of these failures are ambiguous. None require interpretation. Each is documented in timestamped
    email correspondence, in the institution's own records, in the very archive from which their case was built.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:12px">The pattern does not suggest a process that failed. It suggests a process
    that was never genuinely intended to succeed for this student. The decision preceded the procedure.
    The procedure was the record.</p>
